This folder contains 'solo' objects. The idea is that, for the handful of times you need to use a 'Model' class without any owning UISchema or full Panel, you can use these. They are just enough of a skeleton to take a schema and load it into a Model class, or to poke at the model class for debugging or other standalone usage.

The intent is to get rid of these later on, as everything should eventually migrate to the full UI framework.
